# Java-River-Simulator
This is a river simulation app that uses the observer pattern and JAvaFx to simulate an economy around a "river".

I ran this application using IntelliJ IDEA

This simple pplication will show "plots" of land that are around a river. By clicking the "Add" checkbox, the user can then add an agriculture or recreation area in one of the plots. These both cost a certain amount of money upfront, but they will provide returns over time. The users current money information can be seen in the top right. By clicking a particular plot, that plots info will be shown in the top right. If you want to move time forward one month, click the "Next Month" button. The current year, plots filled, and funds can be seen at the bottom of the screen. 

Every few months, the river will flood, and the plotd of land around the river will get destroyed.
